  * Tuple is a value class:
  * - Tuples are usually smaller and occur often, so we don't want boxing overhead
  * - since it is a value class we loose the advantage of specializing, but that's ok since Tuple is defined on Double only!
  *
  * Value classes are trouble for runtime performance: https://failex.blogspot.be/2017/04/the-high-cost-of-anyval-subclasses.html
